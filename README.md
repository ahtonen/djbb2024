# Training for DJBB 2024

This repository explores my training data for [Discover Jamaica By Bike (DJBB) 2024](https://discoverjamaicabybike.com).

## Data

I pulled data from my Strava account by using [these instructions](https://github.com/Cloudy17g35/strava-api/tree/main). Rides were recorded with [Garmin Edge 530](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/621224) and most other activities with [Polar Pacer Pro](https://www.polar.com/en/pacer-pro) or with [Polar Club Finland](https://support.polar.com/fi/polar-club).

## Code

See [this Jupyter notebook](./training.ipynb). 

## Blog

Plots and insights generated in the code were used in my [Medium blog series about the training](https://medium.com/@PekkaAhtonen/list/djbb2024-d17ce57073ed).
